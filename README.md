# Image-Segmentation-Techniques-and-Analysis

This project is done as part of the course Digital Image Processing where it discusses about the image segmentaion techniques and the analysis done on images. <br>
Used Techniques are: <br>
- Multiple thresholding using Otsu Method
- K-Means Clustering
- Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC)
- Multi-layer feedforward network
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

1) For the Multiple thresholding using Otsu Method, K-Means clustering and SLIC, one of the famous image of "Buildings in New York City" is used.
2) For the Multi-layer feedforward network and Convolutional Neural networks (CNN), MNIST hand writing dataset is considered to train, test and validate for image segmentation and analysis.
